//using articulation point and bridges
//in this problem we are using articulation points
//the articulation point specifies if the vertex is removed
//if its an articulation point than it specifies that 
//there will me more than one component
//we just need to take count and every time the current node
//is in articulation point than we have to increase count
//count==1 means that there are 2 components and count==2 means
//there are 3 components here goes by increasing

//for root we have to calculate the articulation point
//differently and we have to see if calls from root is one 
//than there is always only one component
//if the calls are more than one than calculate components on 
//the basis of articulation point
